Here, you will find API documentation of the FleCSI runtime abstraction
layer.
The abstraction layer provides a portable interface for defining
and executing tasks and kernels, defining and accessing field data,
utilities for creating command-line options, a logging utility (flog),
an interface for performance analysis using
[Caliper](http://software.llnl.gov/Caliper), and an I/O interface for
analysis and checkpoint/restart.

Additionally, this API documentation covers the core FleCSI topology
types, along with utilities designed to aid in the creation of
application specialization libraries.
