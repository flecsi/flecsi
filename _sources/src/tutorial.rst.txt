Tutorial
********

This tutorial attempts to give a basic introduction to the design
philosophy and structure of the FleCSI programming system. Each
subdirectory contains example codes that can be compiled with CMake.
Details on how to build the tutorials are given below.

.. attention::

  The tutorial is primarily designed as an introduction for application
  developers, i.e., we do not go into the details of designing or
  implementing the specialization layer, and the discussion of core
  FleCSI features is limited to the high-level execution and data
  interfaces.

  Because a specialization layer is necessary to use FleCSI, we have
  provided a simple mesh interface as part of the tutorial. Users who
  are interested in the basic structure of a mesh topology
  specialization are encouraged to examine the source code in the
  *specialization* subdirectory of this tutorial (The complete source
  code is in the *tutorial/specialization* subdirectory of the main
  project.)

----

Requirements
++++++++++++

The tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed FleCSI
somewhere on your system. Instructions for different install methods are
available here: :ref:`build`.

Once you have built and installed FleCSI, add the path to your
installation to your *CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH*:

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/flecsi/install/dir:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

----

Building the Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++

The tutorial uses a standard CMake build system. To configure and build
the examples, execute the following steps from the *tutorial*
subdirectory of the FleCSI source:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

----

Using the Docker Container
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The tutorial is also available as a Docker container.
This simplifies getting and installing FleCSI and its dependencies.
In general, FleCSI docker images are available from the
`flecsi organization on dockerhub.com`__.

__ https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/flecsi/flecsi

.. include:: install_docker.rst

Pulling the Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To pull the tutorial image, do:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker pull flecsi/flecsi:tutorial

This will download the image to your machine. Once the pull is complete,
you can run the image like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker run -it flecsi/flecsi:tutorial

This will place you into a bash prompt, from which you can build and run
the tutorial examples. The tutorials are in the *tutorial* directory in
*/home/flecsi*.

Tutorial Examples
+++++++++++++++++

The tutorial examples are designed to guide the reader through basic to
more advanced FleCSI concepts.
