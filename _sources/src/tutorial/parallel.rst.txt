Distributed and shared memory parallelism 
**********

----

FleCSI provides two different levels of parallelism: distributed memory
parallelism and shared memory parallelism.

Distributed memory parallelism is provided through topology coloring and
distribution of the data between different processes (shards). 
FleCSI provides macros *forall* and *reduceall* for shared memory
parallelism. Currently, it uses Kokkos programing model.

Example 1: forall macro
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This example is an extension to the data-dense tutorial example with the
only difference of an additional "modify" task that uses *forall* macro
and is executed on the FleCSI default accelerator.  

Second template parameter to the execute function is a *processor_type*
with *loc* (latency optimized core) as a default value.
*default_accelerator* is a processor type that corresponds to Kokkos
default execution space. For example, if Kokkos is bult with Cuda and
Serial, Cuda will be a default execution space or *toc* (throughput
optimized core) *processor type* in FleCSI.
