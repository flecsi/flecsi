Data Model
**********

FleCSI provides a data model that integrates with the task and kernel
abstractions to provide easy registration and access to various data
types with automatic dependency tracking.

.. sidebar:: Field definitions in headers

   Declaring field definitions as ``const`` namespace members gives them
   internal linkage. When putting them in headers make sure to declare them
   as ``inline const`` to avoid breaking the One-Definition Rule (ODR).

Example 1: Global data
++++++++++++++++++++++

Global fields are used to store global variables/objects that can be
accessed by any task.  For the common case of only one value for each field, it
is natural to use the ``data::single`` layout.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/4-data/1-global.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-at: template<typename T>
  :end-at: const single<double>::definition<global> gfield;

To create a topology instance, declare a *topology slot* and then use ``allocate`` with an argument appropriate to the topology called a *coloring*.
In general, a coloring describes the structure of a topology and its distribution among colors.
The global topology is a special case that does not actually use colors; its "coloring" is simply a count of values for each field.
Writing to a global field requires a single task launch.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/4-data/1-global.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-at: void
  :end-at: // advance()

Example 2: Index data 
+++++++++++++++++++++

A field on an ``index`` topology stores one value for each color.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/4-data/2-index.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-at: using namespace flecsi;
  :end-at: // advance()

Example 3: Dense data
+++++++++++++++++++++

A dense field is a field defined on a dense topology index space.  In
this example we allocate a `pressure` field on the `cells` index space
of the `canonical` topology.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/4-data/3-dense.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-at: const field<double>::definition<canon, canon::cells> pressure;
  :end-at: const field<double>::definition<canon, canon::cells> pressure;

One can access the field inside of the FleCSI task by passing
topology and field accessors with `access permissions` (wo/rw/ro).  
The ``canonical`` topology is a very simple specialization of the ``unstructured`` core topology.
It illustrates the use of the ``mpi_coloring`` type, which applies a specialization-defined rule for specifying a coloring.
Here, a file is the source of the mesh (for purposes of illustration).
The resulting coloring is used to initialize two meshes ``canonical`` and ``cp``, and the ``copy`` task operates on both of them at once using a low-level accessor.
The ``init`` and ``print`` tasks, by contrast, use a *topology accessor* as a parameter that provides access to the structure of the mesh via the ``entities`` function.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/4-data/3-dense.cc
  :language: cpp
  :start-at: void
  :end-at: // advance()
