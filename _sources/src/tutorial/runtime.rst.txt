Runtime Model
*************

Using FleCSI requires proper initialization and configuration of the
FleCSI runtime. These examples illustrate some of the basic steps and
options that are available.

----

Example 1: Minimal
++++++++++++++++++

The core FleCSI runtime has three control points: *initialize*, *start*, and
*finalize*. These must be invoked by the user's application code in that
order.

.. sidebar:: Top-level Action

  The top-level action is a C++ function created by the user to tell
  FleCSI what it should do when the *start* control point is invoked.

* **initialize** |br|
  This control point spins up the FleCSI runtime, and (optionally) any
  other runtimes on which FleCSI depends.

* **start** |br|
  This control point begins the actual runtime execution that forms the
  bulk of any simulation that is performed using FleCSI. The user must
  pass a top-level action that FleCSI will execute.

* **finalize** |br|
  This control point shuts down the FleCSI runtime, and any other
  runtimes that FleCSI itself initialized.

This example demonstrates a minimal use of FleCSI that just executes an
action to print out *Hello World*. Code for this example can be found in
*tutorial/1-runtime/1-minimal.cc*.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/1-minimal.cc
  :language: cpp

.. note::

  - The top-level action can be any C/C++ function that takes no
    arguments and returns an int.  In this simple example, we only print
    a message to indicate that the top-level action was actually
    executed by FleCSI. However, in a real application, the top-level
    action would execute FleCSI tasks and other functions to implement
    the simulation.  

  - The main function must invoke initialize, start, and finalize on the
    FleCSI runtime. Otherwise, the implementation of main is left to the
    user.

  - The status returned by FleCSI's initialize method should be
    inspected to see if the end-user specified --help on the command
    line. FleCSI has built-in command-line support using Boost Program
    Options. This is documented in the next example.

----

Example 2: Program Options
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FleCSI supports a program options capability based on `Boost Program
Options`__ to simplify the creation and management of user-defined
command-line options. The basic syntax for adding and accessing program
options is semantically similar to the Boost interface (You can find
documentation using the above link.) However, there are some notable
differences:

* FleCSI internally manages the boost::program_options::value variables
  for you, using boost::optional.

* Positional options are the mechanism that should be used for
  *required* options.

* Default, implicit, zero, and multi value attributes are specified in
  the flecsi::program_option constructor as an std::initializer_list.

This section of the tutorial provides examples of how to use FleCSI's
program option capability.

__ https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/doc/html/program_options.html

Example Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, imagine that you have a program that takes information
about a taxi service (The options are silly and synthetic. However they
demonstrate the basic usage of the flecsi::program_option type.) The
command-line options and arguments for the program allow specification
of the following: trim level, transmission, child seat, purpose
(personal or business), light speed, and a passenger list. The first two
options will be in a *Car Options* section, while the purpose will be
under the *Ride Options* section. The passenger list is a positional
argument to the program. The help output for the entire program looks
like this:

.. code-block:: console

  Usage: runtime-program_options <passenger-list>

  Positional Options:
    passenger-list The list of passengers for this trip [.txt].

  Basic Options:
    -h [ --help ]                         Print this message and exit.

  Car Options:
    -l [ --level ] arg (= 1)              Specify the trim level [1-10].
    -t [ --transmission ] arg (= manual)  Specify the transmission type
                                          ["automatic", "manual"].
    -c [ --child-seat ] [=arg(= 1)] (= 0) Request a child seat.

  Ride Options:
    -p [ --purpose ] arg (= 1)            Specify the purpose of the trip
                                          (personal=0, business=1).
    --lightspeed                          Travel at the speed of light.

  FleCSI Options:
    --backend-args arg             Pass arguments to the backend. The
                                   single argument is a quoted string of
                                   backend-specific options.
    --flog-tags arg (=all)         Enable the specified output tags, e.g.,
                                   --flog-tags=tag1,tag2. Use '--flog-tags=all'
                                   to show all output, and
                                   '--flog-tags=unscoped' to show only unguarded
                                   output.
    --flog-verbose [=arg(=1)] (=0) Enable verbose output. Passing '-1' will strip
                                   any additional decorations added by flog and
                                   will only output the user's message.
    --flog-process arg (=0)        Restrict output to the specified process id.
                                   The default is process 0. Use
                                   '--flog_process=-1' to enable all processes.

This shows the program usage, the basic options, e.g., ``--help``, the
command-line and positional options for the example, and some auxiliary
options for controlling the FleCSI logging utility *FLOG* (described in the
next section of this tutorial). The FLOG options will only appear if
*ENABLE_FLOG=ON* was set in your FleCSI build.

Declaring Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  FleCSI program options must be declared at namespace scope, i.e.,
  outside of any function, class, or enum class. This is not a problem! It
  is often convenient to declare them in a header file (in which case,
  they must also be declared *inline*), or directly before the *main*
  function.  We use the latter for this example simply for conciseness.

Let's consider the first *Car Options* option: ``--level``. To declare
this option, we use the following declaration:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 17-32

First, notice that the flecsi::program_option type is templated on the
underlying option type *int*. In general, this can be any valid C++
type.

This constructor to flecsi::program_option takes the following
parameters:

* *section ("Car Options")*: |br|
  Identifies the section. Sections are generated automatically, simply
  by referencing them in a program option.

* *flag ("level,l")*: |br|
  The long and short forms of the option. If the string contains a
  comma, it is split into *long name,short name*. If there is no comma,
  the string is used as the long name with no short name.

* *help ("Specify...")* |br|
  The help description that will be displayed when the usage message
  is printed.

* *values ({{flecsi::option_default, ...}})* |br|
  This is a
  std::initializer_list<flecsi::program_option::initializer_value<int>>.
  The possible values are flecsi::option_default,
  flecsi::option_implicit, flecsi::option_zero, and
  flecsi::option_multi. The default value is used if the option is not
  passed at invocation. The implicit value is used if the option is
  passed without a value. If zero is specified, the option does not take
  an argument, and an implicit value must be provided. If multi is
  specified, the option takes multiple values.

* *check ([](flecsi::any const &, std::stringstream & ss...)* |br|
  An optional, user-defined predicate to validate the value passed by
  the user.

The next option ``--transmission`` is similar, but uses a std::string
value type:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 34-49

The only real difference is that (because the underlying type is
std::string) the default value is also a string.

The last option in the "Car Options" section ``--child-seat``
demonstrates the use of flecsi::option_implicit:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 51-63

Providing an implicit value, defines the behavior for the case that the
user invokes the program with the given flag, but does not assign a
value, e.g., ``--child-seat`` vs. ``--child-seat=1``. The value is
*implied* by the flag itself.

.. caution::

  This style of option should not be used with positional arguments
  because Boost appears to have a bug when such options are invoked
  directly before a positional option (gets confused about separation).
  We break that convention here for the sake of completeness. If you
  need an option that simply acts as a switch, i.e., it is either *on*
  or *off*, consider using the ``--lightspeed`` style option below, as
  this type of option is safe to use with positional options.

The first option in the *Ride Options* section ``--purpose`` takes an
integer value *0* or *1*. This option is declared with the following
code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 65-81

This option demonstrates how an enumeration can be used to define
possible values. Although FleCSI does not enforce correctness, the
enumeration can be used to check that the user-provided value is valid.

The next option in the *Ride Options* section ``--lightspeed`` defines
an implicit value and zero values (meaning that it takes no values). The
``--lightspeed`` option acts as a switch, taking the implicit value if
the flag is passed.  This will be useful to demonstrate how we can check
whether or not an option was passed in the next section:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 83-91

The final option in this example is a positional option, i.e., it is an
argument to the program itself:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 93-107

Positional options are required, i.e., the program will error and print
the usage message if a value is not passed.

Checking & Using Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FleCSI option variables are implemented using an *optional* C++ type.
The utility of this implementation is that *optional* already captures
the behavior that we want from an option, i.e., it either has a value,
or it does not. If the option has a value, the specific value depends on
whether or not the user explicitly passed the option on the command
line, and its default and implicit values.

Options that have a default value defined do not need to be tested:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 118-146

Here, we simply need to access the value of the option using the
*value()* method.

For options with no default value, we can check whether or not the
option has a value using the *has_value()* method:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 148-155

Our one positional option works like the defaulted options (because it
is required), and can be accessed using the *value()* method:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/2-program_options.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 157-168

Here is the full source for this tutorial example:

Example 3: FLOG (FleCSI Logging Utility)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FLOG provides users with a mechanism to print logging information to
various stream buffers, similar to the C++ objects std::cout, std::cerr,
and std::clog.
Multiple streams can be used simultaneously, so that information about
the running state of a program can be captured and displayed at the same
time.
In this example, we show how FLOG can be configured to stream output to
a file buffer, and the std::clog stream buffer.

Before attempting this example, you should make sure that you have
configured and built FleCSI with ENABLE_FLOG=ON.
Additional useful options are:

* FLOG_ENABLE_COLOR_OUTPUT=ON
* FLOG_ENABLE_TAGS=ON
* FLOG_STRIP_LEVEL=0
* FLOG_ENABLE_DEBUG=OFF
* FLOG_DEVELOPER_MODE=OFF

.. important::

  One of the challenges of using distributed-memory and tasking runtimes
  is that output written to the console often collide because multiple
  threads of execution are all writing to the same descriptor
  concurrently.
  FLOG fixes this by collecting output from different threads and
  serializing it.
  This is an important and useful feature of FLOG.

Buffer Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, FLOG does not produce any output (even when enabled).
In order to see or capture output, your application must add at least
one output stream.
This should be done after flecsi::initialize has been invoked, and
before flecsi::start.
Consider the main function for this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 71-110

The first output stream added is `std::clog`__.

__ https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/clog

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 92-96

The arguments to add_output_stream are:

* *label ("clog")*: |br|
  This is an arbitrary label that may be used in future versions to
  enable or disable output. The label should be unique.

* *stream buffer (std::clog)*: |br|
  A std::ostream object.

* *colorize (true)*: |br|
  A boolean indicating whether or not output to this stream buffer
  should be colorized. It is useful to turn off colorization for
  non-interactive output. The default is *false*.

To add an output stream to a file, we can do the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 98-103

That's it! For this example, FLOG is now configured to write output to
std::clog, and to *output.txt*. Next, we will see how to actually write
output to these stream buffers.

Writing to Buffers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Output with FLOG is similar to std::cout. Consider the FLOG *info*
object:

.. code-block:: cpp

  flog(info) << "The value is " << value << std::endl;

This works just like any of the C++ output objects. FLOG provides four
basic output objects: *trace*, *info*, *warn*, and *error*. These
provide different color decorations for easy identification in terminal
output, and can be controlled using *strip levels* (discussed in the next
section).

The following code from this example shows some trivial usage of each of
the basic output objects:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 32-40

Controlling Output - Strip Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important::

  If FleCSI is configured with ENABLE_FLOG=OFF, all FLOG calls are
  compiled out, i.e., there is no runtime overhead.

The strip level is a preprocessor option *FLOG_STRIP_LEVEL* that can
be specified during FleCSI configuration. Valid strip levels are
*[0-4]*. The default strip level is *0* (most verbose). Depending on
the strip level, FLOG limits the type of messages that are output.

* *trace* |br|
  Output written to the trace object is enabled for strip levels less
  than 1.

* *info* |br|
  Output written to the info object is enabled for strip levels less
  than 2.

* *warn* |br|
  Output written to the warn object is enabled for strip levels less
  than 3.

* *error* |br|
  Output written to the error object is enabled for strip levels less
  than 4.

Controlling Output - Tag Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tag groups provide a mechanism to control the runtime output generated
by FLOG. The main idea here is that developers can use FLOG to output
information that is useful in developing or debugging a program, and
leave it in the code. Then, specific groups of messages can be enabled
or disabled to only output useful information for the current
development focus.

To create a new tag, we use the log::tag type:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 22-27

Tags take a single std::string argument that is used in the help message
to identify available tags.

.. important::

  FLOG tags must be declared at namespace scope.

Once you have declared a tag, it can be used to limit output to one or
more *scoped* regions. The following code defines a guarded section of
output that will only be generated if *tag1* or *all* is specified to
the ``--flog-tags`` option:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 42-53

Here is another code example that defines a guarded section for *tag2*:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/3-flog.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 55-66

You should experiment with invoking this example:

Invoking this example with the ``--help`` flag will show the available
tags:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./runtime-flog --help

which should look something like this:

.. code-block:: console

  Usage: runtime-flog

  Basic Options:
    -h [ --help ]         Print this message and exit.

  FleCSI Options:
    --backend-args arg             Pass arguments to the runtime backend. The
                                   single argument is a quoted string of
                                   backend-specific options.
    --flog-tags arg (=all)         Enable the specified output tags, e.g.,
                                   --flog-tags=tag1,tag2. Use '--flog-tags=all'
                                   to show all output, and
                                   '--flog-tags=unscoped' to show only unguarded
                                   output.
    --flog-verbose [=arg(=1)] (=0) Enable verbose output. Passing '-1' will strip
                                   any additional decorations added by flog and
                                   will only output the user's message.
    --flog-process arg (=0)        Restrict output to the specified process id.
                                   The default is process 0. Use
                                   '--flog_process=-1' to enable all processes.

  Available FLOG Tags (FleCSI Logging Utility):
    tag2
    tag1

Invoking this example with ``--flog-tags=tag1`` will generate output for
unguarded sections, and for output guarded with the *tag1* tag:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./flog --flog-tags=tag1
  [trace all p0] Trace level output
  [info all p0] Info level output
  [Warn all p0] Warn level output
  [ERROR all p0] Error level output
  [trace tag1 p0] Trace level output (in tag1 guard)
  [info tag1 p0] Info level output (in tag1 guard)
  [Warn tag1 p0] Warn level output (in tag1 guard)
  [ERROR tag1 p0] Error level output (in tag1 guard)

FLOG Options (CMake)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defaults for the FLOG options have been chosen in an attempt to most
closely model the behavior one would expect from the execution and
output of a standard MPI program.
However, because of the asynchronous nature of FleCSI's execution model,
it is important to understand the options that control FLOG's behavior,
as it can sometimes be counter-intuitive.

As stated in the preceding sections, FLOG buffers and serializes output
to avoid collisions from different threads.
As a safeguard, FleCSI's default settings flush these buffers
periodically, so as to avoid memory capacity issues.
The CMake configuration options ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_INTERVAL`` and
``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_THRESHOLD`` define this behavior:

* *FLOG_SERIALIZATION_INTERVAL* |br|
  The serialization interval specifies how often FleCSI should check for
  buffered output (requires reduction) as a number of
  tasks executed, i.e., if the serialization interval is set to 100,
  FleCSI will check how many messages have been injected into the stream
  of each process every multiple of 100 task executions. |br|
  *(default: 1024)*

* *FLOG_SERIALIZATION_THRESHOLD* |br|
  The serialization threshold sets the number of messages that must have
  accumulated before output will be collected (requires reduction) to a
  single process and written to the output streams. |br|
  *(default: 1024)*

.. caution::

  It is important to understand and tune FLOG serialization to your
  application.
  Serialization inhibits task asynchrony.
  When balanced, the performance effects should be very minimal.
  However, overly aggressive settings, e.g.,
  ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_INTERVAL=1``, and
  ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_THRESHOLD=1``, could force complete serialization
  of your application.
  This can be beneficial for debugging, but should not be used for
  actual simulation runs.

For many applications, there is a natural serialization interval that
implicitly starts at the beginning of the simulation time evolution.
FleCSI provides a function ``flecsi::log::flush()`` that can be used to
force FleCSI to serialize, and flush output.

.. tip::

  Best practice for FLOG serialization is to leave the default settings
  for ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_INTERVAL`` and
  ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_THRESHOLD``, and to use ``flecsi::log::flush()``
  at an appropriate point in your application to force output.

FLOG Options (Command-Line)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have already covered the ``--flog-tags`` option.
There are currently two other options that control FLOG output:

* *--flog-verbose* |br|
  This option controls how much additional information is output with
  your ``flog(severity)`` message.
  A value of ``-1`` will turn off any additional decorations, while a
  value of ``1`` will add additional information.
  By default, the severity level and process are output. |br|
  *(default: 0)*

* *--flog-process* |br|
  This options allows the user to restrict output to the specified
  process id.
  A value of ``-1`` will enable output of all processes.
  By default, output is restricted to process ``0``. |br|
  *(default: 0)*

.. caution::

  By default, FLOG only writes output to process ``0``. Pass
  ``--flog-process=-1`` to enable output from all processes.

.. tip::

  Logging output can sometimes have unexpected behavior.
  Consider the case where you are viewing output only from process
  ``0``, and the runtime maps a task to process ``1``.
  You will not see the messages from that task in the logging output.
  This is not an error.
  In general, some experimentation is necessary to achieve the desired
  level of output with FLOG and FleCSI.


Example 4: Caliper Annotations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `Caliper <https://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/>`_ Annotation interface in
FleCSI is used internally to inject Caliper instrumentation throughout the code.
This enables users to investigate runtime overhead and application performance
with Caliper.  Users can also use this interface to add additional annotations
to performance sensitive regions of their applications.

To CMake variable *FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL* is used to disable or control the
level of detail in included Caliper annotations.  The currently available
options are:

* *FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL=none* |br|
  Caliper annotations are disabled
* *FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL=low* |br|
  Annotations marked with low severity detail are included
* *FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL=medium* |br|
  Annotations marked with low and medium severity detail are included
* *FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL=high* |br|
  All annotations are included

.. caution::

   To use Caliper annotations with the Legion backend, the Legion option
   ``--ll:force-kthreads`` must be used.  Caliper is not aware of Legion
   user-level threads, so additional care must be practiced when using
   annotations with this runtime.


Adding Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to instrumenting FleCSI runtime overhead, the annotation interface
can be used to add annotations to applications.  This allows users to instrument
their code and use Caliper to collect timing data.  An annotation for a code
region must specify a detail level, context, and name.  The detail level is used
to selectively control the inclusion of an annotation using the cmake variable
*FLECSI_CALIPER_DETAIL*.  The context for an annotation is used as a named
grouping for annotations.  In caliper, this can be used to filter and aggregate
annotations using the `caliper query language <http://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/calql.html>`_.

To annotation a code region, either scope guards or explicit begin and end
functions are called.  Consider the main function for this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/4-caliper.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 72-90

A scope guard is used to annotation the top level task:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/4-caliper.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 82-84

For this region, the FleCSI execution context ``annotation::execution`` is
specified along with a detail level of ``annnotation::detail::low``.
To avoid hard coding strings throughout an application, annotation regions can be
specified using structs that inherit from ``annotation::region``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/4-caliper.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 25-46

This first defines a new annotation context ``user_execution`` by inheriting
from ``annotation::context`` and specifying a name for the context.  Three code
regions are then defined using this context.  The first two regions use the
default detail level of ``annotation::detail::medium``.  The main function is
then annotated using a scope guard:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/4-caliper.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 74-74

The sleeper function demonstrates the use of calls to begin and end as opposed to using scope guards:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/4-caliper.cc
  :language: cpp
  :lines: 53-55

Generating Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Caliper configuration files
<http://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/configuration.html>`_ can be used to generate
configure caliper to generate reports for annotated regions of the code.  For
example, consider the following caliper configuration file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../tutorial/1-runtime/caliper.config
  :language: bash

This file defines three caliper configuration profiles that can be used to
generate reports using the ``mpireport`` service (see
http://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/services.html).  This service aggregates
timings across all ranks using ``CALI_MPI_REPORT_CONFIG`` query statements.  For
example, to run with the second configuration profile in this file (named
user), ensure ``caliper.config`` is in your working directory and run with::

  CALI_CONFIG_PROFILE=user ./runtime-caliper

When the program completes, caliper flushes the aggregated timings to a report
file named ``report.cali``::

  User-Execution  count min-time max-time total-time-%
  sleeper/subtask     1 0.400095 0.400095    57.141409
  sleeper             2 0.300089 0.300089    42.858591

The output represents collected timings for annotations in the
``User-Execution`` annotation context.
