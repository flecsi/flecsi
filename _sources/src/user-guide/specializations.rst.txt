Specializations
***************
A *specialization* is an adaptation of one or more core FleCSI topologies to
create an interface that is suitable for developers of a family of 
domain-specific applications.

For example, in the Poisson tutorial a specialization is provided to define a
two-dimensional finite-difference domain interface required by applications
with nearest-neighbor ghost dependencies.
