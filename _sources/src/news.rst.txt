Release Notes
*************

``flecsi::`` qualification is omitted throughout.

.. Each release has as sections some subsequence of Removed, Other
   incompatibilities, Possible incompatibilities, Deprecated, New features,
   and Fixed.

   Each such section discusses some subsequence of Build, Runtime, Data,
   Execution, Topologies, Legion backend, MPI backend, On-node parallelism,
   Utilities, and Logging.

Changes in v2.2.1 (July 12 2023)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fixed
^^^^^
* Runtime

  * Control policy objects are value-initialized by ``run::control::execute``.
  * Unrecognized options are properly rejected along with unrecognized positional arguments.
  * The same exit status is used for all erroneous command lines.
  * Special options like ``--control-model`` and ``--help`` don't produce spurious error messages as a side effect.
  * Control-model graphs are labeled with the program name.
  * Control model output strips parameters, return values, wrappers, and common
    namespaces from actions for better readability.

* Data

  * ``ragged`` accessors with ``wo`` privileges work for GPU tasks. (The field type must still be trivially default-constructible.)

* Utilities

  * ``transform_view`` supports pointers to members (though not during constant evaluation).

Changes in v2.2.0 (April 14 2023)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Possible incompatibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Build

  * ``FLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL`` is renamed to ``FLECSI_BACKEND`` (it never referred to :ref:`TUT-RM`).

* Utilties

  * ``util::mdspan::operator()`` is removed (it had an inconsistent argument order).

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^
* Runtime

  * ``control::state`` |mdash| derive the control policy type from ``control_base`` and define actions accepting a reference to it
  * ``run::control_point`` |mdash| use ``control_base::point``
  * ``run::cycle`` |mdash| use ``control_base::cycle``

* Data

  * ``global_topology`` and ``process_topology`` |mdash| create instances of ``topo::global`` and ``topo::index`` as needed

* Utilities

  * in ``util::annotation``, ``begin`` and ``end`` |mdash| use ``guard`` or ``rguard``

* Logging

  * The namespace ``flecsi::log`` |mdash| use ``flecsi::flog`` instead
  * The CMAKE option ``FLOG_SERIALIZATION_THRESHOLD`` is not used anymore 

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Build

  * The HIP compiler is supported.

* Runtime

  * Control policies may inherit from ``control_base`` to be provided to actions, to allow those actions to throw ``control_base::exception``, and to limit their lifetime to that of ``control::execute``.
  * ``control_base::meta`` defines special control points for a specialization's use via ``control::meta``.
  * New option ``--Xbackend`` to pass single backend arguments. Can be used multiple times.

* Data

  * ``field_reference::get_elements`` and associated types allow control of the storage for elements of ragged/sparse fields.
  * ``launch::mapping`` allows field data to be accessed from other colors (using ``multi`` task parameters) with the Legion backend.
  * ``topology_slot::colors`` reports on the number of colors for an allocated topology.
  * ``reduction_accessor`` allows ``dense`` fields on a ``global`` topology to be updated collectively.
  * The ``particle`` layout supports efficient creation and destruction of unordered field elements.
  * Field definitions are copyable and may be destroyed after use.
  * Fields may be of non-portable types so long as they are used only by MPI tasks.
  * ``single`` accessors support ``->`` to access the members of a field value of class type.

* Execution

  * Tasks may be executed as ``omp``, allowing efficient use of OpenMP.
  * ``exec::trace`` improves performance of loops when used with the Legion backend.
  * ``task_local`` objects define global variables with task-local values.

* Topologies

  * ``unstructured`` represents unstructured meshes.
  * ``narray`` represents hyperrectangular arrays, including structured meshes.
  * ``global`` topology instances may be created with sizes other than 1.
    (All elements are shared together among all point tasks in an index launch.)
  * ``util::id`` and ``util::gid`` store topology-entity IDs.

* MPI backend

  * The ``toc`` processor type is supported.

* On-node parallelism

  * ``parallel_for``, ``forall``, ``parallel_reduce``, and ``reduceall`` may be used without Kokkos enabled, in which case they run serially.
  * ``mdiota_view`` provides support for multi dimensional ranges. Supports ``full_range``, ``prefix_range`` and ``sub_range`` options.

* Utilities

  * ``unit.hh`` provides macros, based on Google Test, for writing unit tests in or outside of tasks.
  * ``serial`` provides a general-purpose serialization interface.
    It may be extended to allow additional types to be used as task parameters or with MPI communication.
  * ``mdcolex`` accesses a multi-dimensional array using Fortran-like syntax.
  * ``mpi::one_to_alli`` scatters generated and/or serialized data with bounded memory usage.
  * MPI communication functions compute values to send in rank order and support mutable functors.
  * ``substring_view`` represents part of another range.
  * ``equal_map`` and ``offsets`` represent partitions of integer ranges.

* Logging

  * ``flog_fatal`` suppresses backtraces (already unavailable if ``NDEBUG`` is defined) unless ``FLECSI_BACKTRACE`` is set in the environment.
  * ``flog`` is a new name that avoids collisions with ``::log`` in code lacking proper namespace qualifications.

Fixed
^^^^^
* Build

  * HDF5 is supported by the CMake configuration.
  * Caliper is supported by the MPI backend.
  * Building with the MPI backend properly links to the threading library.
  * Added ``FLECSI_VERSION`` define to record version

* Runtime

  * Certain control-flow graphs compile with Graphviz support and are drawn correctly.
  * ``--backend-args`` can be specified multiple times. The collected arguments are passed to the backend.
  * MPI and Kokkos are initialized with no arguments (so that they cannot misinterpret arguments not meant for them).

* Data

  * Mutators support write-only privileges (which, as with accessors, are necessary to properly initialize fields).
  * Mutators work on fields over zero index points.

* Topologies

  * Topology accessors that provide metadata for direct access in a ``toc`` task work properly when writable (although without such direct access in that case).

* Legion backend

  * Certain user-level fields are allocated properly.
  * MPI tasks with reference parameters support argument conversions correctly.
  * Errors at process termination in certain configurations are avoided.
  * Accessors with both ``wo`` and ``na`` privileges are processed correctly.

* MPI backend

  * ``exec::fold::min`` and ``exec::fold::max`` work with ``bool`` (but may be slower than using another type like ``int``).
  * Index futures work properly when declared ``const``.
  * Index futures work with ``bool`` return type.

* On-node parallelism

  * More accessor and topology accessor functions are available on a device.
  * Several uses of "iterator" in documentation have been corrected to use "range".

* Logging

  * Tags work correctly in tasks executed in parallel.
  * Messages are sorted by timestamp correctly.
  * Exiting the process before ``flecsi::finalize`` does not crash.

Changes in v2.1.0 (April 16 2021)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Topologies

  * ``topo::help`` is a convenient base class for specialization class templates that defines the non-dependent names in ``specialization``.

Changes in v2.0.0 (March 30 2021)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The changes between versions 1 and 2 are extensive and so are merely summarized here.
The broadest change is that macros are used only for on-node parallelism constructs and for logging.
Some macro arguments become template arguments.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Runtime

  * Application command-line options can be specified using the ``program_option`` class template and associated helper functions.
  * The ``control`` class template is used to define an extensible control model for an application.

* Data

  * The ``raw`` and ``single`` layouts support special cases of field usage.

* Execution

  * Tasks can be (specializations of) function templates.
  * Tasks can accept parameters of dynamic size (*e.g.*, ``std::vector<double>``), although passing large objects is inefficient.
  * Index launches can be of any number of point tasks (determined by the task's arguments, including ``exec::launch_domain``).
  * ``test`` conveniently executes tasks for unit testing.

* Topologies

  * Multiple user-defined topology instances may exist sequentially or simultaneously.
