      FleCSI is a compile-time configurable framework designed to
      support multi-physics application development. As such, FleCSI
      provides a very general set of infrastructure design patterns that
      can be specialized and extended to suit the needs of a broad
      variety of solver and data requirements. FleCSI currently supports
      multi-dimensional mesh topology, geometry, and adjacency
      information, as well as n-dimensional hashed-tree data structures,
      graph partitioning interfaces, and dependency closures.

      FleCSI introduces a functional programming model with control,
      execution, and data abstractions that are consistent both with MPI
      and with state-of-the-art, task-based runtimes such as Legion and
      Charm++. The abstraction layer insulates developers from the
      underlying runtime, while allowing support for multiple runtime
      systems including conventional models like asynchronous MPI.

      The intent is to provide developers with a concrete set of
      user-friendly programming tools that can be used now, while
      allowing flexibility in choosing runtime implementations and
      optimizations that can be applied to future architectures and
      runtimes.
   
      FleCSI's control and execution models provide formal nomenclature
      for describing poorly understood concepts such as kernels and
      tasks. FleCSI's data model provides a low-buy-in approach that
      makes it an attractive option for many application projects, as
      developers are not locked into particular layouts or data
      structure representations.
